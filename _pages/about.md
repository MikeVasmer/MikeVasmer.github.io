I am a researcher working in the exciting field of quantum information. 
In my work I focus on quantum error correction: making sure that quantum computers function correctly even when some of their components go wrong. 
This research is crucial in the quest to build large-scale quantum computers and also has surprising connections to various fields of mathematics, physics, and computer science.

I did my PhD at University College London, where my supervisor was [Dan Browne](https://sites.google.com/site/danbrowneucl/).
Then I was a joint postdoctoral fellow at Perimeter & IQC, working in the group of [Raymond Laflamme](https://laflamme.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/).
Most recently, I was a Senior Quantum Architecture Researcher at <a href=https://www.xanadu.ai>Xanadu</a> and a Research Scientist at Perimeter.
