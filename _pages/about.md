I am a researcher working in the exciting field of quantum information.
In my work I focus on **quantum error correction**, i.e., making sure that quantum computers function correctly even when some of their components go wrong.
This research is crucial in the quest to build large-scale quantum computers and also has surprising connections to various fields of mathematics, physics, and computer science.

I did my PhD at University College London, where my supervisor was [Dan Browne](https://sites.google.com/site/danbrowneucl).
After that I was a joint postdoctoral fellow at [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca) & [IQC](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing), working in the group of [Raymond Laflamme](https://laflamme.iqc.uwaterloo.ca).
Most recently, I worked as a Senior Quantum Architecture Scientist at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai) and as a Research Scientist at Perimeter Institute.
I am currently a visiting fellow at Perimeter Institute and an associate member of IQC.
